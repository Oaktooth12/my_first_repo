Git hub is very confusing to understand so far.
git branch <branch_name> (Create a new branch)
• git checkout <branch_name> (Switch to a branch)
• git merge <branch_name> (Merge a branch into the current one)
git branch -m
git add

Pull requests ar good for collaborates to change code that the owner can see when the pull request is created.
if the owner likes and approves the changes they can merge it to the main branch and get rid of the collaborators branch if wanted or needed
